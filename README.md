# IT 610 Project Midterm
For this project I decided to create a docker container for my personal interactive resume.

The web app is made with React and was created with the "create-react-app" boilerplate command.

## Running the React App
The example commands are applicable to a Windows PowerShell terminal
Start by cloning this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bah34/IT610Project.git
```
Navigate to the project's root directory:
```
cd .\IT610Project\
```
